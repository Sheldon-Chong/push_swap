# push_swap
The push_swap program is designed to sort a stack of integers using only a limited set of operations, called "moves", while minimizing the total number of moves. The purpose of this project is to create an efficient-as-possible algorithm for sorting a stack, with the help of one additional stack. 

## üìñ Topics covered in push_swap
- Bits and bit-wise operators
- Linkedlists
- Sorting algorithms, Time complexity


## ‚¨áÔ∏è Clone
```
git clone git@github.com:Sheldon-Chong/push_swap.git
```


## ‚èØÔ∏è Compile and run
```
make
./push_swap <list_of_numbers>
```

Example
```
./push_swap 5 3 2 1 4
```

Use the following to generate a random set of numbers quickly
```
shuf -i 1-100 -n 5
```

The program output prints each operation used sequentially, that lead to the numbers being sorted.

## ‚ùì Breaking down this project

Below are the maximum allowable moves for the following stack sizes:
- 3 integers: 3 moves or less 
- 5 integers: 12 moves or less 
- 100 integers: 700 moves or less
- 500 integers: 5,500 moves or less

This project allows the following operations to be used to manipulate both stacks. Part of the project involves coding an implimentation for these operations

Additionally, for the bonus section of this project, I had to create a tester program that takes the operations printed by pushswap, and verifies if it actually sorts the output, by executing the operations itself. It works as a way to validate whether your program's output of operations were correct. 

## My experience with this project

For my sorting algorithm, I utilized radix sort, which is a relatively straightforward algorithm, yet is very effective at sorting a large set of numbers. 

Radix sort is typically conducted using base-10 numbers (0-9). However, for the case of radix sorting using 2 stacks, it meant I had only 2 buckets to sift between numbers. Hence, what I regard as the main challenge was brushing up on my knowledge of binary and binary operators for manipulation and comparisons, and adapting this approach to radix sort. Essentially, it was a matter of converting base10 to base2.
